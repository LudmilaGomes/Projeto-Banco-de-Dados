# Project | Biblioteca Virtual | Bando de Dados

## About the Project

The idea for this project was developed to practice the use of Node.js. Biblioteca Virtual was also used for the Banco de Dados subject projects.

Biblioteca Virtual is a system that manipulates and manages the data of a fictional library, storing information about books, users, librarians, fines, and loans.

## Available Scripts


`meu-projeto-node` and `program` are two different modules, and each one is placed in different folders. After that, in each directory, you use the `npm install` command to download the dependencies used in each one.

In the project (`meu-projeto-node`) directory, you can run `yarn local` to run the server locally (after configuring the database on your machine), and the database will be ready to be used!

In the program directory (`program/src`), you can run `node mp2.js` to access an interactive program. Within this program, you can utilize CRUD system methods to manage information and data within the Biblioteca Virtual.
