# Project | Biblioteca Virtual | Bando de Dados

## About the Project

<p>The idea for this project was developed to practice the use of Node.js and for projects in the Banco de Dados discipline.</p>
<p>Biblioteca Virtual is a system that manipulates and manages the data of a fictional library, storing information about books, users, librarians, fines, and loans.</p>

## Available Scripts


`meu-projeto-node` and `program` are two different modules, and each one is placed in different folders. After that, in each directory, you use the `npm install` command to download the dependencies used in each one.

In the project (`meu-projeto-node`) directory, you can run `yarn local` to run the server locally (after configuring the database on your machine), and the database will be ready to be used!

In the program directory (`program/src`), you can run `node mp2.js` to access an interactive program. Within this program, you can utilize CRUD system methods to manage information and data within the Biblioteca Virtual.
